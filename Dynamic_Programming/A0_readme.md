Dynamic Programming: Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the results for future use to avoid redundant computations.


Approaches to DP:

1. Top-down (Memoization): Solve the problem recursively and store the results of subproblems in a cache.
2. Bottom-up (Tabulation): Solve smaller subproblems first and use their results to build up solutions for larger problems iteratively.


If you are strugling with this concept, trust me mate this is easy if you follow this path/sequence of problems.

        Make sure your Data Structures concepts is clear and than you should approch these problems by using:
            1. Recuesion
            2. Iteration
            3. Memoization(for some)
        in same order.

        Step 1: Basic Problems
            • Fibonacci Problem
            • Staircase Problem
        Step 2: 1d Array Problems
            • Longest Increasing Subsequence
            • Minimum Jumps To Reach End
            • Loot Houses
        Step 3: 2d Array Problems
            • Min Cost path
            • 0-1 Knapsack
        Step 4: Strings
            • Longest Common Subsequence
            • Edit Distance
            • Find if a string is interleaved of two other strings

        --> After this you can consider that your basic in Greedy is now strong and you  
            approch to more advance problems.

        Step 5: Counting Problems
            • Coin Change
            • Count Balanced Binary Trees Of Height h
        Step 6: Breaking And Partition Problems
            • Palindrome Partitioning
            • Partition Equal Subset Sum
        Step 7: Mathematical Problems
            • Matrix Chain Multiplication
            • Best Time To Buy And Sell Stock
        Step 8: Standard problems
            • Rod Cutting
            • Count Palindromic Subsequences
            • Longest Palindromic Substring

        --> After finishing above Problems you can do some leetcode question in order to 
            test yourself.
